Of course. Here is a detailed, step-by-step guide from start to finish. I'll include the names for each action, the code you need to paste, and exactly which dynamic content to select.

üìã Prerequisites
Genesys Cloud OAuth Client: You need a Client ID and a Client Secret. Make sure it has the wfm:historicaladherence:view permission.

Management Unit ID: Have the ID of the Management Unit you want to query ready.

Excel File: Create an Excel file in OneDrive or SharePoint. Inside that file, create a worksheet and format a range of cells as a table (Insert > Table). Give the table a name (e.g., AdherenceData). Create column headers like UserName, UserEmail, AdherencePercentage, etc., that match the data you want to capture.

}
Action (inside loop): Set variable - jobStatus

Search for and add the "Set variable" action.

Stage 4: Download and Process the Results into Excel
These actions go after the "Do until" loop.

Action: HTTP - Download Results

Action Name: Rename it to HTTP - Download Results.

Method: GET

Important: Do not add any headers or authentication to this step. The URL is pre-signed.

Action: Extract archive (OneDrive)

Source File Path: Select the adherence_report.zip file you just created.

Destination Folder Path: Choose a folder where the contents will be extracted.

Action: Get file content (OneDrive)

This gets the actual JSON data from the unzipped folder.

File: Navigate to the destination folder from the previous step and find the file named adherence-report.json.

Action: Parse JSON - Final Adherence Data

Content: Select File Content from the previous "Get file content" step.

Schema: The schema depends on all the fields you want. A simple one for key metrics is:

JSON

{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "data": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "userName": { "type": "string" },
                    "adherencePercentage": { "type": "number" },
                    "userEmail": { "type": "string" }
                },
                "required": ["userName", "adherencePercentage", "userEmail"]
            }
        }
    }
}
Control: Apply to each

Select an output from previous steps: Select data from the Parse JSON - Final Adherence Data step.

Inside this loop, add the final action:

Action (inside loop): Add a row into a table (Excel)

Location: Select the location of your Excel file (OneDrive, SharePoint).

Document Library / File / Table: Select your file and the table you created in the prerequisites.

Power Automate will show your table's columns. Map the dynamic content from the Parse JSON - Final Adherence Data step to the correct columns (e.g., userName from JSON goes to the UserName column in Excel).
