You are a solutions architect specializing in Microsoft Teams Voice and advanced contact center functionalities.

Context

Our organization has a single team of senior-level agents. All agents in this team are peers and have the same level of authority. They all answer customer calls that arrive through a single Microsoft Teams Call Queue and they use the "Queues" app to manage their call-related activities.

Primary Goal

I need to enable any senior agent on this team to monitor a live call being handled by another senior agent (their peer). The capability must be reciprocal, meaning if Agent A can monitor Agent B, Agent B must also be able to monitor Agent A.

Specific Functional Requirements

The desired feature is live call monitoring, often referred to as "Call Control" or "Supervisory" features in a contact center. Specifically, when one agent is on an active call from the queue, another agent must be able to:

1. Listen In: Silently join the call to hear both the agent and the customer without either of them knowing.


2. Whisper Coach: Speak directly to their fellow agent without the customer hearing, in order to provide live guidance.


3. Barge In: Join the call fully, enabling a three-way conversation between both agents and the customer.



This functionality should ideally be accessible from within the Microsoft Teams client, perhaps through the "Queues" app or a similar interface.

Your Task

Please provide a detailed technical guide to achieve this peer-to-peer live call monitoring. Structure your response to answer the following:

1. Native Feature Analysis: Is live call monitoring (Listen, Whisper, Barge) a standard feature available in Microsoft Teams?


2. Licensing Requirements: If it is a native feature, what specific Microsoft licenses are required for each agent to enable this? (e.g., Teams Phone Standard, Teams Premium, Teams Rooms Pro, etc.).


3. Configuration Guide: Provide a step-by-step process for an administrator to configure this in the Teams Admin Center. Crucially, explain how to set up the permissions for a peer-to-peer model, rather than a traditional, rigid supervisor-to-agent hierarchy.


4. End-User Workflow: Describe exactly how an agent would initiate a monitoring session. Where in the Teams client do they go? What buttons do they click to Listen, Whisper, or Barge on a teammate's active call?


5. Limitations & Alternatives: If this exact peer-to-peer model is not natively possible, clearly state the limitations. Then, propose the best alternative solutions, such as certified third-party CCaaS (Contact Center as a Service) providers that integrate directly into Microsoft Teams to deliver this functionality.
